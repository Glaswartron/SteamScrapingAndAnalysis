# SteamScrapingAndAnalysis
#### A personal project to gather data about Steam games and do some Data Science on it
The goal of this project is to scrape the store.steampowered.com website and use its API to gather data about video games, create a large dataset and do analysis / data science on it.

#### At the moment the project can be broken down into 3 logical components:

#### Steam Scraping and Dataset Creation
- Steamscraper.py is the core of dataset creation: It scrapes the Steam store website and creates a dataset in the form of a csv file out of it
- HardwareParser.py is a regex-based utility extract the system requirements of the games in a consistent format

#### Data Analysis
- SteamData.csv is the dataset generated by Steamscraper.py. It can be used completely standalone in your own projects.
- SteamAnalysis.ipynb is a notebook where I try out different things using pandas, matplotlib, ... and look for interesting insights about data.

#### Hardware Dataset Creation
The goal of this is to get better insights into the hardware requirements of Steam games and their distribution. The contents of this section can be used standalone.
- GPUDatasetCreation.ipynb is a notebook used to create a table of NVIDIA GPUs place them on a normalized, harmonized performance scale.
- NvidiaGPUs.csv is a dataset of of NVIDIA GPUs placed on a normalized, harmonized performance scale using data from various online performance tests.
